### Workflow for Assignment Submissions

If you're using GitHub Desktop, these general instructions will help:

* <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>
* <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/>

Enabling `Edit`->`Automatically Sync after Committing` is recommended. Here are the steps:

1. _Fork_ the repository for the assignments.
2. Clone the _forked_ repository to your computer.
3. Modify the files to complete your solution.
4. It is required that you submit your report in an easily readable format. We strongly suggest using a Jupyter notebook. Don't forget to add and commit any file you wish to submit. 
5. Push/sync up to GitHub.
6. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository.
7. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (listed in Classes) – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.
